# ICC profiles

`sRGB-v2-micro.icc` is the sRGB profile `convert_images.py` converts every image to and embeds in its output (`SRGB_PROFILE`). At 456 bytes it's much smaller than a standard sRGB profile (~7 KB), which saves that much in every JPEG and PDF page. Converting with it differs from the standard `sRGB.icc` by at most 1 level of 255.
